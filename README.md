# Webflow-svg-text-animation

Custom code snippets to animate SVG text on Webflow by giving it a 'drawn in' effect when scrolled into view. 

We are using an Intersection Observer to detect when an element is scrolled into view, and then animating the specified element with a stroke animation by adding a class to the element. 

### How to implement this project in webflow ? 

There are two files here that we will use to create this animation effect. The javascript code will be found in main.js, the css styling will be found in main.css.
