# Webflow-svg-text-animation

Custom code snippets to animate SVG text on Webflow by giving it a 'drawn in' effect when scrolled into view. 

There are two files here that we will use to create this animation effect. The javascript code will be found in main.js, the css styling will be found in main.css

## How to implement this project in webflow ?
